This package extends the `UnityEventDrawer` to display runtime calls in the inspector.

### What is "runtime calls"?

*Button.onClick* and *Toggle.OnChangeValue* etc. are known as [UnityEvent](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Events.UnityEvent.html).  
UnityEvent has two types of callbacks:

* Persistent call
  * You can add callbacks from the inspector.
  * You can add callbacks from a script using *UnityEventTools.AddPersistentListener*.
  * It will be serialized and displayed in the inspector.  
    ![persistent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12690315/40887795-f5eb7ac4-6788-11e8-9e73-6831e3eab08f.png)
* **Runtime call**
  * You can add a callback from a script with *UnityEvent.AddListener*.
  * It will be **not** serialized and displayed in the inspector.
    ![runtime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12690315/40887784-c8c2027a-6788-11e8-83f7-07e38e187cba.png)

### Display your runtime calls

This package extends *UnityEventDrawer* to display runtime calls in the inspector.  
If the runtime call is an instance method, its target is also displayed.  
This plugin supports all events that inherit `UnityEvent<T0> - UnityEvent<T0, T1, T2, T3>` as well as *UnityEvent*.  
Even if the persistent call is empty, *UnityEvent* is displayed compactly in the inspector.

```cs
public class TestBehavior : MonoBehaviour
{
	[System.Serializable] public class TransformUnityEvent : UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent<Transform>{};

	[SerializeField] TransformUnityEvent onYourCustomEvent = new TransformUnityEvent();
	
	void OnEnable()
	{
		onYourCustomEvent.AddListener(TestTransform);
	}
	
	void TestTransform(Transform t)
	{
		Debug.Log("TestTransform has called : " + t);
	}
}
```

If you like a style of development that makes heavy use of runtime calls (MVP pattern, etc.), this package is for you!
